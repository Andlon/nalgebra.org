**nalgebra** relies on the official Rust package manager
[Cargo](https://crates.io) for dependency resolution and compilation. Therefore,
making **nalgebra** ready to be used by your project is simply a matter of
adding a new dependency to your `Cargo.toml` file.

```toml
[dependencies]
nalgebra = "*" # replace * by the latest version of the crate.
```

Until **nalgebra** reaches 1.0, it is strongly recommended to always use its
latest version, though you might encounter breaking changes from time to time.
Once your `Cargo.toml` file is set up, the corresponding crate must be imported
by your project with the usual `extern crate` directive. We recommend using the
`na` abbreviation for referencing the crate throughout your application.

```rust
extern crate nalgebra as na;
```

## Cargo example
Here is a complete example of `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[package]
name    = "example-using-nalgebra"
version = "0.0.0"
authors = [ "You" ]

[dependencies]
nalgebra = "*" # replace * by the latest version of the crate.

[[bin]]
name = "example"
path = "./example.rs"
```

## Usage and cargo features
**nalgebra** is a monolithic crate with all its functionalities exported at its
root. Data types, traits, and functions that do not take mutable inputs are
directly accessible behind the `nalgebra::` path (or `na::` if you use the
recommended alias). However, methods that perform in-place modifications
(normalization, appending a translation in-place, etc.) are not accessible as
free-functions. Instead, see the details of each data structure and the traits
they implement.

Finally, many optional features can be enabled if needed:

| Feature name | Effect |
|--------------|--------|
| **abomonation-serialize** | Makes it possible to serialize using [abomonation](https://crates.io/crates/abomonation) |
| **arbitrary** | Makes it possible the use of [quickcheck](https://crates.io/crates/quickcheck) by adding implementations of their `Arbitrary` trait. |
| **io** | For parsing matrices from files using the [matrix market format](https://math.nist.gov/MatrixMarket/). |
| **libm** | For allowing the use of the [libm](https://crates.io/crates/libm) crate to make features based on special math functions work on `#[no-std]` targets. |
| **libm-force** | For forcing the use of the [libm](https://crates.io/crates/libm) crate in order to make sure the implementations of all special math functions will be the same of all the platforms. |
| **serde-serialize** | Makes it possible the use of [serde](https://serde.rs) by adding implementations of the `Serialize` and `Deserialize` traits. |
| **sparse** | To make the `na::sparse` module available for sparse matrix computations. |
