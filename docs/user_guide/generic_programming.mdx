**nalgebra** allows several kind of generic programming, either through traits
of the **simba** crate, or by keeping the various type parameters of the
`Matrix<T, R, C, S>` structure and the likes. In the end, this allows for:
* **Genericity wrt. scalars**: the most common kind of abstraction.
  This allows you to write code that will work on any scalar group like `i32`
  and fields like `f32` or `f64`.
* **Dimensional genericity**: allows you to write code that will work
  generically for 2D, 3D, and higher dimensions.


## Genericity wrt. scalars
This allows to write code that works with algebraic entities constructed on top
of a generic scalar type, e.g., floating-point numbers like `f32` or `f64` and
in some more restrictive cases integers like `i32` or `u64`.  This can be
achieved by keeping generic the first type parameter `T` of any structure of
**nalgebra** (including aliases). The mandatory trait bound of `T` is
`na::Scalar` which imposes some simple non-mathematical properties, i.e., `T`
must copyable, printable (using the `{:?}` [format
string](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/index.html#formatting-traits)), and
comparable using the equality operator. Other commonly used trait bounds for
`T` are `na::RealField` or `na::ComplexField` from the
[simba](https://docs.rs/simba) crate. This
enables operator overloading and useful mathematical functions for signed
integers and floating point numbers respectively. Note that the `Scalar` trait
bound does not have to be specified if `Real` already is.

```rust
use na::{RealField, Scalar, Vector3};

fn print_vector<T: Scalar>(m: &Vector3<T>) {
  println!("{:?}", m)
}

fn print_norm<T: RealField>(v: &Vector3<T>) {
  // NOTE: alternatively, nalgebra already defines `v.norm()`.
  let norm = v.dot(v).sqrt();

  // The Real bound implies that T is Display so we can
  // use "{}" instead of "{:?}" for the format string.
  println!("{}", norm)
}

fn main() {
  let v1 = Vector3::new(1, 2, 3);
  let v2 = Vector3::new(1.0, 2.0, 3.0);

  print_vector(&v1);
  print_norm(&v2);
}
```
